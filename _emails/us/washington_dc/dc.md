subject: DC Resident for Defunding the Metropolitan Police Department
body: "To the DC council in charge of the allocation of funds to the Metropolitan
  Police Department and its respective members, \t\n\nMy name is [your name], and
  I am a resident of Washington, D.C. This past week, our nation has been gripped
  by protests calling for rapid and meaningful change with regard to police behavior,
  an end to racism and anti-blackness, and immediate reform in how black people are
  treated in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly,
  it has come to my attention that there will be a council meeting in June that will
  discuss the budget for the Metropolitan Police Department. \t\n\nThe MPD is a pillar
  of inequality in our city. Just last year, it was reported that most police stops
  involved Black people. I am concerned that the proposed increase for the upcoming
  fiscal year will only serve to entrench this prejudice and worsen the disproportionate
  impact on Black DC residents. \t\n\nThe brutal, senseless, and violent murder of
  George Floyd at the hands of police officers derelict in their duties to protect
  and serve is deeply disturbing. We, as a nation, are in need of a drastic overhaul
  in policing. Systems of oppression must be undone, and reallocating much of the
  budget for the MPD to programs and city-led initiatives that support education,
  rehabilitation, public health, and community-oriented initiatives is a goal that
  must be achieved. I implore you to reconsider the upcoming budget. We are overdue
  for change.\n\nSincerely,\n[your name]\n"
