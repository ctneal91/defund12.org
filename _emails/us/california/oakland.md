subject: Oakland Resident for Defunding the OPD
body: |-
  To Mayor Schaaf, the Oakland City Council and Oakland and Alameda County Elected Officials:

  My name is \[YOUR NAME\], and I am a resident of Oakland. This past week, our nation has been gripped by protests calling for a rapid and meaningful reconsideration of the role of policing in communities as well as an end to racism and anti-Blackness in America. Our city has been at the forefront of much of this action. Accordingly, it has come to my attention that the budget for 2021 is being decided as these protests continue.

  OPD has been a waste of our resources. Last year, the OPD budget was approximately half of available discretionary funds. While weâ€™ve been spending extraordinary amounts on policing, we have not seen improvements to safety, homelessness, mental health, or affordability in our city. Instead, we see wasteful and harmful actions of our police.

  I call on you to slash the OPD budget and instead meaningfully reallocate funds towards social programs and resources that support housing, jobs, education, health care, child care, and other critical community needs. I demand a budget that supports community wellbeing, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  We can be a beacon for other cities to follow if only we have the courage to change.

  Sincerely,

  \[YOUR NAME\]
  \[YOUR ADDRESS\]
