subject: Reallocate police budget to social services
body: |-
  Dear Westchester County Legislature,

  Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am a resident of [TOWN]. I am asking you to reallocate money away from the Westchester County Police Department. According to a 2018 report, black people are the subjects of 42% of all arrests in Westchester despite making up only 14% of our population: https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/comparison-population-arrests-prison-demographics/2018%20Population%20Arrests%20Prison%20by%20Race.pdf. Furthermore, black people convicted of a crime in Westchester are sentenced to jail time at a higher rate than any those of any other race, across all types of crimes: https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/dispositions-adult-arrest-demographics/2018/Westchester.pdf

  County police is the third-highest line item in the 2020 county budget, but research shows that a living wage, access to health services and treatment, educational opportunity, and stable housing are far more successful at promoting community safety than policing and prisons. As such, I demand a meaningful reallocation of police department funds towards healthcare and social programs.

  Sincerely,

  [YOUR NAME]
