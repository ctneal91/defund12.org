  Dear Mayor Krewson and President Reed,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD/CITY]. I am extremely concerned with the City of St. Louis’s inordinate investment in the Metropolitan Police Department of St. Louis (SLMPD) at the expense of critical youth, education, and health services. The budget for FY2021 explicitly states a goal to "increase the number of police officers to support public safety measures throughout the City", which I believe to be counterproductive to our shared goal of public safety.

  I am therefore writing to demand that the Board of Aldermen vote to reapportion funds allocated to the SLMPD to support evidence-based programs and services that, unlike increased police presence, promote the well-being of citizens and reduce crime. It is unacceptable to dedicate $140 million per year towards policing in the name of safety; the attack on undercover officer Luther Hall in 2017, and the text messages that were revealed in the subsequent indictment, definitively reveal a total lack of accountability for a police department that truly does not care about the safety and well-being of its residents. I do not believe that this incident reflects solely on the officers responsible, but on the department as a whole.

  In the words of Blake Strode, executive director of ArchCity Defenders, “Now is the time to defund policing and instead fund alternative, more-effective systems of safety and justice. We see in practice that robust investments in education, jobs, healthcare, stable housing, and public infrastructure are the only real antidotes to crime. All over the country, communities are building networks of mutual support and accountability to respond when harm occurs. The options are plentiful, from social workers to community organizers to crisis response teams. We must develop and embrace practices that prioritize our health, humanity, and collective wellbeing.”

  People are marching in the streets because they know that these actions will result in a healthier, more just society. I implore you to please listen to the needs of your constituents and take immediate action to address their concerns.

  Thank you,
