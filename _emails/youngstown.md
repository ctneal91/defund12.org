subject: Defund the Youngstown Police Department
body:
  Dear Mayor and City Council
  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Youngstown, Ohio.

  The City of Youngstown must do better by its residents. I am urging you to divest from the criminalization of our communities and reduce police spending in the budget for the 2021 fiscal year. The City of Youngstown has already announced about deep cuts in the very departments that our community needs most (parks and rec, public works, community development), while the Youngstown Police Department budget has continued to climb.

  In 2020, the Youngstown Police Department budget increased to almost $18 million dollars, considerably larger than any other city department. With this excessive spending, our streets are not safer.

  Now especially, the Mayor and City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black and Brown communities–starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful parts of the Youngstown Police Department budget.

  Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities–it happens here in Youngstown. We see it in the disproportionate imprisonment of black people, and in the racialized inequality that is prevalent in the Mahoning Valley. The City Council must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown communities need to be safe and healthy:\ COVID-19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, healing, access to fresh and healthy food, community centers, among other things.

  Thank you,
